1. Give Circulation a More Active Role
Currently, you define two states circulation (certainty) and rest (a gamble). We could imagine that the mode of circulation influences the currency:
 * Spending on a local good → increases the "stability" of the Chiffres (they mutate less quickly if they return to the bank).
 * Spending on a risky project (startup, speculation) → increases their future volatility.
Thus, the currency remembers how it has circulated.
2. Introduce GEMs or Catalysts
You've already mentioned GEMs for Hauterroir. Here, they could become probability modifiers in the casino:
 * Holding GEMs can reduce the magnitude of a loss, or conversely, multiply a gain.
 * GEMs can be linked to concrete actions (planting a tree, donating to a charity, participating in a project).
   → This links the currency to ethics and ecology, not by force, but by creating a subtle incentive.
3. Add a Temporal Dimension
We could introduce a cycle of time:
 * Mutations are not uniform but follow rhythms (days, seasons, years).
 * Example: At the winter solstice, large fortunes risk a stronger mutation (a symbol of passing through darkness).
This makes the system more mythical and gives the economy a ritualistic aspect.
4. Link the Monetary Ether to Collective Actions
Currently, the Ether is passive. We could make it interactive:
 * When too many people stagnate, the Ether thickens, and the overall value decreases → this incites everyone to restart circulation.
 * When everyone is spending, the Ether becomes scarcer, increasing the value → this encourages a bit of saving.
   → This creates an organic self-regulation.
5. Give a Symbolic Role to the "Weights"
The Weights (light or heavy) could be more than just a matter of size:
 * Light Weights: assimilated to wind, water → fast, changing.
 * Heavy Weights: assimilated to earth, fire → massive, transformative.
   → We could make each fortune correspond to a natural element, adding a cosmological dimension.
6. Integrated Governance
To prevent the system from being seen as pure "chance," we could introduce a Council of Chiffres:
 * Not a central bank, but an open assembly that adjusts certain parameters (frequency of mutations, weight of the Ether).
 * Their decisions are themselves subject to gambles! (e.g., a decision can backfire on them if the Ether evolves poorly).

In summary, you could enrich the theory in three directions:
 * Memorization: The Chiffres remember how they have circulated.
 * Ethics/Ecology: Via GEMs, concrete actions modify the probabilities.
 * Mythology & Cycles: Linking mutations to seasons, elements, or a universal symbolism.
